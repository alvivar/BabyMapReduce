    The detail connecting to Docker MemSQL was to use the correct driver
    version: MySQL ODBC 5.3 ANSI Driver, not the latest.

    Blocker: Installing the Hive ODBC 64 bits version was an error, only
    connections created with 32 bits show on Visual Studio. Classic.


    I learned here about the port 10000, exposing it Hive ODBC for connections
